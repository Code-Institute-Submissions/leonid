            <hr class="underline">
            <p>A native of kilmeaden Waterford, Leonid (real name Paul Smith) became interested in electronic music from a young age along with twin brother Alan. During this period in the nineties Waterford City was spoilt with legendary House/Techno nights such as Cant Stop and Man Fridays in The Roxy and Metroland along with Sir Henry's of Cork an hour and a half away. So weekly visits to these venues became a passion and it wasnt long before Leonid began buying turntables, vinyl and production equipment to pave his own path in the Irish electronic music scene. Currently residing in Madrid, Leonid regularly DJ's around Spain and Europe and releases vinyl on various European/US labels.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">DJ Career</h2>
            <hr class="underline underline-b">
            <p>It wasnt long before Leonid began playing small venues and partys such as the Dub Club in Waterford City, developing a style varying from Deep House grooves to soulful US Techno and heavier British and European sounds from the likes of Surgeon.  A few years living in Madrid lead to regular gigs in the Spanish capital before returning to Ireland which lead to playing various other venues in Waterford and Dublin including the DEAF festival and a residency with Eamonn Doyles D1 nights.  Now residing back in Madrid Leonid plays regularly in Madrid and Valencia as well as throughout Europe including appearances in the legendary Berghain and Tresor in Berlin. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Production</h2>
            <hr class="underline underline-c">
            <p>Production would be a natural progression from DJ'ing and so a Roland MC303 hailed the beginning of a career in making his own music.  More gear additions would be added over time including a Novation Drumstation, Roland JP8080, Akai MPC2000xl and Midas Venice 32 channel desk.  Leonid has stuck to a hardware only midi setup and has also acquired some vintage Roland and analogue synths along with various effects all combined to craft his own unique sound. The first vinyl release came with a track on a various artists EP on German imprint Statik Entertainment, followed by a full EP which then led to various other labels such as Sistrum Detroit, Dolly, Photic Fields, Eleve and Into the Deep. </p>
